Simple PhotoSwipe uses the built in gallery features of WordPress but gets extended by using PhotoSwipe from Dmitry Semenov.

== Description ==

Simple Photoswipe extends Wordpress' built in gallery functionality and uses Dmitry Semenov's awesome [Photoswipe](http://photoswipe.com/) gallery library. 

You can customize some of Photoswipes options at Settings > Simple Photoswipe.

**Important Note:** In order to use Photoswipe zoom effect correclty you need to disable thumbnail cropping! 
By default your images will be cropped to proportional 150x150 thumbnails. I would reccomend to set a bigger thumbnail size (as shown in screenshot 4) and re-upload your images. In case you don't want to re-upload your images I would recommend another plugin to automatically recrop your uploaded images.
